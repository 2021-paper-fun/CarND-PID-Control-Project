    "## PID controller\n",
    "The **P**(proportional) **I**(integral) D(differential) controller is a procedure for applying\n",
    "continuous correction to steering, so that the cross track error (CTE) is kept low.\n",
    "However, it should be noted that PID controllers are used in a wide variety of applications, not just\n",
    "for steering an autonomous car.\n",
    "Still, I am going to continue with the writeup by focusing on the steering angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steering angle is controlled by the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\texttt{Angle}_t = - K_P\\cdot \\texttt{Error}_t - K_I\\int_{0}^t \\texttt{Error}_{t'} dt' - K_D\\cdot \\frac{d \\texttt{Error}_t}{d t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $K_P$, $K_I$, and $K_D$ are coefficients that need to be selected so that the mean $\\texttt{Error}$ is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **P** component is proportional to the CTE, and if no other component is present, it can lead very high oscillations. On the other hand, it needs to be high enough for the car to stay on track. So whenever I increased $K_P$ (so that the car would follow the trail), I was expecting that I'll need to account for higher oscillations using the other two components.\n",
    "\n",
    "I primarily used the **D** component to \"dissipate\" the excess energy caused by too high a value of the P component. However, a higher value of $K_D$ caused the car to get off track on tighter turns. Also, I expected $K_D$ to have at least an order of magnitude higher value than $K_P$ since the differential $d\\texttt{Error} / d t$ had significanlty lower values than the $\\texttt{Error}$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **I** component was used in the lectures as a means of dealing with the bias sometimes inherent in the car. In the case of the simulator, there was no bias, so I actually expected that there'll be no need of having $K_I \\neq 0$. However, at higher speeds and long turns, when the error continuously amounts, I've observed that setting $K_I$ to a small, non-zero value keeps the car on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the $K_P$, $K_I$, $K_D$ coefficients, I loosely followed the twiddle procedure from the lectures. I started at `(0.005, 0, 0.1)` and iteratively increased $K_P$ by `0.005`, kept $K_I$ at zero, and increased $K_D$ by `0.1`. This way I reached the point `(0.045, 0, 1.2)`, and then I tweaked the first parameter with a finer-grained step of `0.001`, the second with a step of `0.00001`, and the third with a step of `0.05`.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final parameters were: `(0.047, 0.00005, 1.2)` at which point the car is a bit wobbly, but it stays in the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also experimented with a PID controller on the speed, but the process of finding the right coefficients was far too time consuming. Also, the car often sterted reversing, and I felt that this would require hand-holding the model, i.e. adding `if`-s ensuring that the speed is above a certain threshold."
